# BlackScholesModel

Black-Scholes is a pricing model used to determine the fair price or theoretical value for a call or a put option based on six variables such as volatility, type of option, underlying stock price, time, strike price, and risk-free rate.The answers draw heavily on the inputs. Answers are as good as the inputs.The model is used to find the current value of a call option whose ultimate value depends on the price of the stock at the expiration date. Because the stock price keeps changing, the value of this call option will change too. Therefore, if we want to trade this option contract, then we need to use some probabilities to estimate what expected values are involved in the call option today. We need to think about the value we can expect to obtain by buying this option and what we will pay if we exercise the option.
